# Milestones

Milestones are deliberately small enough for one maintainer to land directly
and revise. Follow-up issues are useful only when a slice needs independent
design discussion, external infrastructure, or parallel ownership.

## M0: contract and calibration

- Version the case contract around semantic templates, polarity, negative
  mechanisms, score tiers, semantic dimensions, and model profiles.
- Keep the bootstrap Java taint fixtures as non-scoring calibration cases.
- Reject unbalanced future core templates during validation.
- Document benchmark provenance and scoring before publishing scores.

## M1: Java propagation kernel

Author 16 benchmark-controlled templates, with one positive and one negative
case per template. Use four equally sized strata:

1. local propagation and flow-sensitive kills;
2. calls, returns, and context separation;
3. heap, field, alias, and object separation;
4. branches, loops, exceptions, and other control transfers.

The resulting 32 assertions form the first scored core. Run Bifrost, CodeQL,
and Joern adapters; add OpenTaint when its neutral JVM-rule path is reproducible.

## M2: cross-language parity

Port the same 16 templates to JavaScript and Python without changing their
semantic intent. The shared core contains 96 assertions across three languages.
Language-only constructs live in `language-extension` scorecards.

## M3: taint modeling

Add balanced categories for sources and sinks, propagators, sanitizers, opaque
library summaries, framework entry points, and persistence boundaries. Publish
benchmark-controlled and tool-native model profiles separately.

## M4: real-project confirmation

Add a small, pinned, manually reviewed corpus drawn from executable or
buggy/fixed upstream benchmarks. Keep these results separate from the synthetic
semantic core. Performance and typestate receive independent milestone plans
after the correctness contract is stable.
